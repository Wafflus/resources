# Resources

This repository purpose is for you to have a way to download resources that might be needed in one of my tutorials.

You can check my [Youtube Channel here](https://www.youtube.com/c/IndieWafflus).

# How do I download a folder?

You can either download the whole repository *(which downloads all folders)* or use something like:

**Refined Github Plugin**: https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github

**Download Directory Github**: https://download-directory.github.io/

Refined Github uses the "Download Directory" in its "Download" button:

> File management
> 
> [Adds a button to download entire folders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1402241/35044451-fd3e2326-fbc2-11e7-82e1-61ec7bee612b.png), via https://download-directory.github.io.
